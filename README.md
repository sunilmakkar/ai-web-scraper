## Overview

This is an AI-powered web scraping application built with Streamlit, Selenium, and Ollama, allowing users to scrape website content and extract specific information using natural language prompts.

## Features

- üåê Web Scraping: Extract content from any website
- ü§ñ AI-Powered Parsing: Use natural language to extract precise information
- üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly Interface: Simple Streamlit web application
- üîç CAPTCHA Handling: Integrated CAPTCHA solving mechanism

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Ollama (with Mistral model)
- Chrome WebDriver

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilmakkar/ai-web-scraper.git
cd ai-web-scraper
```

### 2. Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ai_web_scraper_env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation provides a versatile web scraping solution, the most significant enhancement would be to specialize the scraper for a specific industry or use case. By tailoring the scraper to solve a niche problem, such as automated competitive analysis for e-commerce, real estate market research, or job market intelligence, the tool could provide more targeted and valuable insights. Personalization would involve creating custom parsing logic, industry-specific data extraction rules, and potentially integrating domain-specific AI models to improve accuracy and relevance of extracted information.
